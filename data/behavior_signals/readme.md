The "behavio_signals" dataset includes data on likes and viewing duration for each video by participants during both pre-study and post-study phases. 
To protect the privacy of the subjects, we use "member_id" to represent users.
In the like column, a checkmark (âœ“) indicates a like, while a blank space signifies no like was given. The format for representing time in the viewing time column is hours:minutes:seconds.
The "video title" contains information about the type of video. "LAB2" represents post-study, while "LAB1" indicates pre-study. The terms "neutral," "fear," "happy," and "sad" correspond to the four types of videos from the SEED-IV dataset. The names of personages are associated with the type of personage videos. The terms "positive" and "negative" refer to the polarity of the video, which denotes the attitude towards the personage.
