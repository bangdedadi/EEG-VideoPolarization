# Questionnaire Data Overview

The questionnaire data comprises responses from participants during the pre-study and post-study phases. These responses are presented in the form of a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, where:

- `1` represents the lowest score for a question
- `5` represents the highest score for a question

To protect participant privacy, we use `participant_id` to represent users.

## Structure of the Questionnaire

- The questionnaire includes questions about participants' sentiments and familiarity with **10 different personages**, totaling **20 questions**.
- It also contains **distractor questions**, which are unrelated to the personages.

## Consistency and Aim

- The questions in the pre-study and post-study are consistent.
- We aim to reflect changes in participants' sentiments towards the personages after undergoing the field study, based on their responses in both questionnaires.

## Eliminating Biases

- To eliminate potential biases caused by the order of questions, we employed **three different questionnaire setups - A, B, and C**.
- These setups have identical content but the order of questions is randomized.
- Each participant was randomly assigned a questionnaire with one of these orders.
